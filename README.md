# [Sterling File Gateway](https://developer.ibm.com/components/sterling/tutorials/) Tutorial

# Install IBM Sterling B2B Integrator / Sterling File Gateway using a GitOps workflow

<!--- cSpell:ignore gitorg YAMLs -->

The GitOps concept originated from [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/) back in 2017 and the goal was to automate the operations of a Kubernetes (K8s) system using a model external to the system as the source of truth ([History of GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/the-history-of-gitops)).

There are various GitOps workflows this is our opinionated point of view on how `GitOps` can be used to manage the infrastructure, services and application layers of K8s based systems.  It takes into account the various personas interacting with the system and accounts for separation of duties.

Refer to the [https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops) repository for instructions to try out the GitOps workflow.  It is focused around deploying [IBM Cloud Paks](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/paks) on the [Red Hat OpenShift](https://cloud.redhat.com/learn/what-is-openshift) platform.


## GitOps Principles
With the ever growing adoption of GitOps, the [OpenGitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) project was started in 2021 to define a set of open-source standards and best practices.  These will help organizations adopt a standard and structured approach when implementing GitOps.  It is currently a [CNCF Sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/).

The [GitOps Working Group](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group) has released v0.1.0 of the [**GitOps Principles**](https://opengitops.dev/#principles):

1. **The principle of declarative desired state**: A system managed by GitOps must have its Desired State expressed declaratively as data in a format writable and readable by both humans and machines.
2. **The principle of immutable desired state versions**: Desired State is stored in a way that supports versioning, immutability of versions, and retains a complete version history.
3. **The principle of continuous state reconciliation**: Software agents continuously, and automatically, compare a system's Actual State to its Desired State. If the actual and desired states differ for any reason, automated actions to reconcile them are initiated.
4. **The principle of operations through declaration**: The only mechanism through which the system is intentionally operated on is through these principles.


## GitOps Repository Structure
There are a total of 4 Git repositories involved with the GitOps workflow.

- [Main GitOps repository](#gitops) - Repository that the various [personas](#personas) will interact with to update the desired state of the OpenShift cluster.
- [Infrastructure repository](#infrastructure-layer) - Repository
- [Services repository](#services-layer)
- [Application repository](#application-layer)


### **GitOps**
- Main GitOps repository ([https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops)): This repository contains all the ArgoCD Applications for  the `infrastructure`, `services` and `application` layers.  Each ArgoCD Application will reference a specific K8s resource (yaml resides in a separate git repository), contain the configuration of the K8s resource, and determine where it will be deployed into the cluster.

- Directory structure for `single-cluster` or `multi-cluster` profiles:

    ```bash
    .
    ├── 1-infra
    ├── 2-services
    ├── 3-apps
    ├── bootstrap.yaml
    └── kustomization.yaml
    ```

The contents of the `kustomization.yaml` will determine which layer(s) will be deployed to the cluster.  This is based on whether the `resources` are commented out or not.  Each of the listed YAMLs contains an ArgoCD Application which in turn tracks all the K8s resources available to be deployed.  This follows the ArgoCD [app of apps pattern](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern).

```yaml
resources:
- 1-infra/1-infra.yaml
- 2-services/2-services.yaml
- 3-apps/3-apps.yaml
```


### **Infrastructure Layer**
- Infrastructure GitOps repository ([https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops-infra](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops-infra)): Contains the YAMLs for cluster-wide and/or infrastructure related K8s resources managed by a cluster administrator.  This would include `namespaces`, `clusterroles`, `clusterrolebindings`, `machinesets` to name a few.

```bash
1-infra
├── 1-infra.yaml

### **Services Layer**
- Services GitOps repository ([https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops-services](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops-services)): Contains the YAMLs for K8s resources which will be used by the `application` layer.  This could include `subscriptions` for Operators, YAMLs of custom resources provided, or Helm Charts for tools provided by a third party.  These resource would usually be managed by the Administrator(s) and/or a DevOps team supporting application developers.

# Deploy [Sterling File Gateway](https://developer.ibm.com/components/sterling/tutorials/)

This recipe is for deploying the B2BI Sterling File Gateway in a single namespace (i.e. `b2bi-prod`): 

![SFG single NS](images/sfg-single-ns.png)

### Infrastructure - Kustomization.yaml
1. Edit the Infrastructure layer `${GITOPS_PROFILE}/1-infra/kustomization.yaml`, un-comment the following lines, commit and push the changes and <code><i><b>REFRESH</b></i></code> the `infra` Application in the ArgoCD console.

    ```bash        
    cd multi-tenancy-gitops/0-bootstrap/single-cluster/1-infra
    ```

    ```yaml
    - argocd/consolenotification.yaml
    - argocd/namespace-b2bi-prod.yaml
    - argocd/namespace-sealed-secrets.yaml
    - argocd/serviceaccounts-b2bi-prod.yaml
    - argocd/sfg-b2bi-clusterwide.yaml
    - argocd/daemonset-sync-global-pullsecret.yaml
    ```

### Services - Kustomization.yaml

1. This recipe is can be implemented using a combination of storage classes. Not all combination will work, the following table lists the storage classes that we have tested to work:

    | Component | Access Mode | IBM Cloud | OCS/ODF |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | DB2 | RWO | ibmc-block-gold | ocs-storagecluster-cephfs |
    | MQ | RWO | ibmc-block-gold | ocs-storagecluster-cephfs |
    | SFG | RWX | managed-nfs-storage | ocs-storagecluster-cephfs |

1. Edit the Services layer `${GITOPS_PROFILE}/2-services/kustomization.yaml` and install Sealed Secrets by uncommenting the following line, **commit** and **push** the changes and <code><i><b>REFRESH</b></i></code> the `services` Application in the ArgoCD console.
    ```yaml
    - argocd/instances/sealed-secrets.yaml
    ```

    >  💡 **NOTE**  
    > Commit and Push the changes for `multi-tenancy-gitops` & <code><i><b>REFRESH</b></i></code> ArgoCD. 

1. Clone the services repo for GitOps, open a terminal window and clone the `multi-tenancy-gitops-services` repository under your Git Organization.
        
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:${GIT_ORG}/multi-tenancy-gitops-services.git
    ```

2. Modify the B2BI pre-requisites components which includes the secrets and PVCs required for the B2BI helm chart.

    1. Go to the `ibm-sfg-b2bi-prod-setup` directory:

        ```bash
        cd multi-tenancy-gitops-services/instances/ibm-sfg-b2bi-prod-setup
        ```

    1. Generate a Sealed Secret for the credentials.
        ```bash
        B2B_DB_SECRET=db2inst1 \
        JMS_PASSWORD=password JMS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=password JMS_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=password \
        B2B_SYSTEM_PASSPHRASE_SECRET=password \
        ./sfg-b2bi-secrets.sh
        ```

    1. Generate Persistent Volume Yamls required by Sterling File Gateway (the default is set in RWX_STORAGECLASS environment variable to `managed-nfs-storage` - if you are installing on ODF, set `RWX_STORAGECLASS=ocs-storagecluster-cephfs`)

        ```bash
        ./sfg-b2bi-pvc-mods.sh
        ```

    >  💡 **NOTE**  
    > Commit and Push the changes for `multi-tenancy-gitops-services`
    > Please note that the `ApiVersion` for the `PSP` service must be `/v1` if you're using `OCP 4.10+`
    > edit line 2 in the <code>multi-tenancy-gitops-services\instances\ibm-sfg-b2bi-nonprod-setup\ibm-b2bi-rb.yaml</code>
    > file to remove the `beta1`, leaving only `/v1` 

1. Enable DB2, MQ and prerequisites in the main `multi-tenancy-gitops` repository

    1. Edit the Services layer `${GITOPS_PROFILE}/2-services/kustomization.yaml` by uncommenting the following lines to install the pre-requisites for Sterling File Gateway.
        ```yaml
        - argocd/instances/ibm-sfg-db2-prod.yaml
        - argocd/instances/ibm-sfg-mq-prod.yaml
        - argocd/instances/ibm-sfg-b2bi-prod-setup.yaml
        ```

    1. **Optional** Modify the DB2 and MQ storage classes to the environment that you use, the files are in `${GITOPS_PROFILE}/2-services/argocd/instances`. Edit `ibm-sfg-db2-prod.yaml` and `ibm-sfg-mq-prod.yaml` to switch the storageClassName if necessary.


    >  💡 **NOTE**  
    > Commit and Push the changes for `multi-tenancy-gitops` & <code><i><b>REFRESH</b></i></code>
    > ArgoCD `services`.
    >
    > Make sure that the sterling toolkit pod does not throw any error.
    > Wait for 5 minutes until the database is fully initialized. 
   
1. Generate Helm Chart values.yaml for the Sterling File Gateway Helm Chart in the `multi-tenancy-gitops-services` repo; note that the default storage class is using `managed-nfs-storage` - if you are installing on ODF, set `RWX_STORAGECLASS=ocs-storagecluster-cephfs`.

    ```
    cd multi-tenancy-gitops-services/instances/ibm-sfg-b2bi-prod
    ./ibm-sfg-b2bi-overrides-values.sh
    ```

    >  💡 **NOTE**  
    > Commit and Push the changes for `multi-tenancy-gitops-services` 

1. Edit the Services layer `${GITOPS_PROFILE}/2-services/kustomization.yaml` by uncommenting the following line to install Sterling File Gateway, **commit** and **push** the changes and <code><i><b>REFRESH</b></i></code> the `services` Application in the ArgoCD console:

    ```yaml
    - argocd/instances/ibm-sfg-b2bi-prod.yaml
    ```

    >  💡 **NOTE**  
    > This takes around 1.5 hr for the database setup.
    > If you got a BackOff error on OCP, please add your ibm-entitelment-key secret on b2bi-prod that should fix it.

1.
    ```bash
    cd multi-tenancy-gitops-services/instances/ibm-sfg-b2bi-prod
    ```
    1.
      - Inside `values.yaml`, find & set 
        ```bash
        . . .
        datasetup:
          enabled: false
        . . .
        dbCreateSchema: false
        . . .
        ```
- Commit and push the changes for the `multi-tenancy-gitops-services` repo.

### Validation

1.  Retrieve the Sterling File Gateway console URL.

    ```bash
    oc get route -n b2bi-prod ibm-sfg-b2bi-prod-sfg-asi-internal-route-dashboard -o template --template='https://{{.spec.host}}'
    ```

2. Log in with the default credentials:  username:`fg_sysadmin` password: `password` 


### Additional instance of Sterling File Gateway

The current setup has an additional set of customized instance of Sterling File Gateway B2BI in `b2bi-nonprod` namespace. Follow the similar proceure above to run the updates for the `b2bi-nonprod` namespace.
